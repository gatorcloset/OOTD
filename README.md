# OOTDApp

OOTD (Outfit Of The Day) is an application created to help users put together outfits quickly, without the hassle or the mess of trying them on! Users are able to create a digital inventory of their closets and organize their clothes, simply by uploading images from the Internet. OOTD makes it easy for users to generate outfit ideas and create the optimal outfit for the onset of their day and even plan and save outfits for the future.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following tools installed:

Go (version 1.20.3)
Angular CLI (version 15.2.6)
Node.js (version 18.15.0)

** These versions are the optimal version types to install. Depracated versions may not behave as expected.

## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository locally using the following command 
```
git clone https://github.com/gatorcloset/OOTD.git
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
