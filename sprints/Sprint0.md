## Purpose
The purpose of our application is to help users put together outfits quickly, without the hassle or the mess of trying them on! Users are able to create a digital inventory of their closets and organize their clothes. OOTD (Outfit Of The Day) makes it easy for users to generate outfit ideas and create the optimal outfit for the onset of their day and even plan and save outfits for the future.
